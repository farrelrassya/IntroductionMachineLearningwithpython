If fraudsters change their behavior over time, your training data may not reflect current patterns -- a problem called **dataset shift** or **concept drift**.\n",
        "\n",

On the other hand, if the model might save tens of thousands of dollars every month, the problem is worth pursuing. This **back-of-the-envelope ROI calculation** should happen before any code is written."

You have rough positions from GPS. The accelerometer and compass provide precise relative measurements. A structured probabilistic model can express how these measurements relate to the true position and reason about which measurements to trust.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Out-of-core learning:** Data is read from disk in chunks, each chunk is processed, and the model is updated incrementally. Some scikit-learn models support this via the `partial_fit` method. This works on a single machine but can be slow for very large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Distributed computing:** Data is distributed across multiple machines in a cluster, each processing a portion in parallel. Frameworks like **spark MLlib** and **Dask-ML** enable this. The size of data you can process is limited only by the size of the cluster, but the infrastructure complexity is significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, most ML datasets are not as large as you might think. Before investing in distributed infrastructure, ask whether you can **sample** your data intelligently. Often, a well-chosen subset of 100,000 examples trains a model nearly as well as the full 10 million, at a fraction of the cost."

        "\n",
        "**2. Data Collection and Exploration** (Chapters 1, 3): Gather relevant data. Use visualization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction to understand its structure. Check for class imbalance, missing values, and data quality issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Feature Engineering** (Chapters 4, 7): Transform raw data into features the model can use. For tabular data: scaling, encoding categoricals, interaction features. For text: bag-of-words, TF-IDF, n-grams, stemming. Feature engineering is often the single highest-leverage activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Model Selection** (Chapter 2): Choose candidate models based on the nature of the problem:\n",

        "For small datasets with many features → linear models. For large datasets with complex boundaries → ensembles (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting). For images, text sequences → neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Model Evaluation** (Chapter 5): Use cross-validation, appropriate metrics (accuracy, AUC, $F_1$, $R^2$), and learning curves to assess performance. Stratified splits for classification. Remember the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Pipeline Construction** (Chapter 6): Put all preprocessing inside the cross-validation loop using `Pipeline`. Prevent information leakage. Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.\n",

        "**7. Error Analysis** (Chapters 2, 5, 7): Inspect model coefficients, feature importances, confusion matrices, and misclassified examples. Use this analysis to inform the next iteration of feature engineering and data collection.\n",

        "**The algorithm is the easy part.** Problem formulation, data quality, feature engineering, and proper evaluation are where most of the value is created. A simple model with good features and clean data almost always beats a complex model with poor features.\n",

        "**Evaluation is everything.** Cross-validation, proper train/test splits, and business-relevant metrics are non-negotiable. Without rigorous evaluation, you cannot know if your model is helping or hurting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretability matters.** Being able to explain *why* a model makes a particular prediction (through coefficients, feature importances, or topic analysis) is often as valuable as the prediction itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Iterate, don't optimize prematurely.** Build a simple baseline first. Analyze its errors. Then improve -- through better data, better features, or better models, in that order of priority.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Keep the big picture in mind.** Machine learning is a tool in service of a larger goal. The best model in the world is worthless if it solves the wrong problem or cannot be deployed reliably.\n",
